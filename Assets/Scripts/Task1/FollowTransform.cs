/* This script causes the overhead camera to follow a specified Transform instance.
 * The requirements are as follows:
 * A. The camera moves on the X/Z plane.
 * B. The camera has an acceleration and damping effect, meaning it's not "glued" to the
 *    transform, but rather gently adjusts upon transform position change.
 *
 * C. Damping parameters can be adjusted via inspector.
